The paper addresses the problem of construct and test a dataset of captions in Spanish for Image Captioning, and specifically Dense Captioning. The captions used were translated from [Visual Genome](https.//visualgenome.org/api/v0/api_home.html) for [DenseCap](https://github.com/jcjohnson/densecap).

The DenseCap model is a deep convolutional neural network trained in an end-to-end fashion on the Visual Genome dataset.

We provide:

    A dataset of captions in Spanish language
    A pretrained model of DenseCap with the captions in Spanish
    References to the code to run the model on new images, on either CPU or GPU
