The paper addresses the problem of construct and test a dataset of captions in Spanish for Image Captioning, and specifically Dense Captioning. The captions used were translated from [Visual Genome](https://visualgenome.org/api/v0/api_home.html) for [DenseCap](https://github.com/jcjohnson/densecap).

The DenseCap model is a deep convolutional neural network trained in an end-to-end fashion on the Visual Genome dataset.  

We provide:
